<h1>The Tell Tale Heart</h1>
  <h3>By: Edgar Alan Poe</h3>

<p>It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me. You should have seen me. I would have laughed at what you would call the disease. I could not sleep. I had not lost my mind; I had but to use my own; I had to make it part of me... It’s true! Yes, I have been ill—very ill. But why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses—not destroyed—not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily—how calmly I tell you the whole story.
